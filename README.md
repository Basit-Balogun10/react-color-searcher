# REACT-COLOR-SEARCHER

This app is a simple one built with React JS and it basically allows users to:<br>

-   Search for a color name from an array of colors displayed on the screen
-   Add the color to the mock database if the color searched for does not exist
-   Delete existing colors in the mock database.

**React-color-searcher uses a _json-server's_ mock api to store data.**<br>
